This project aims to analyze the impact of US negative economic growth rate on the Indian economy and predict how the Indian economy will perform over the next five years. We use exogenous variables viz, Total Manufacturing Production, Real Effective Exchange Rate, Unemployment Rate, M3 Broad Money Supply, Total Unit Labor Cost: Manufacturing, Consumer Price Index, Total Share Prices and Total Construction of the US Economy for forecasting the US GDP Growth Rate using Random Forest Regressor. Using forecasting techniques, and regression analysis we conclude that impact of recession in US is just 0.02% on Indian Economy. Thus, there is no significant effect of US recession on India's GDP Growth Rate.

Conducted time series forecasting on US GDP data (1960-2022) to predict potential recession trends for the next 5 years. Evaluated the impact of the potential US recession on the Indian economy.
